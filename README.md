# Quantum potentials simulation
Create simulation, using python, of particles in different quantum potentials using solutions of Schr√∂dinger equation.
this repository uses, as bases, the tutorial [quantum mechanics simulation](https://ben.land/post/2022/03/09/quantum-mechanics-simulation/) but it have more.
